# `EVERNYM ui challenge`

This is our challenge for a ui engineering position at [@evernym](https://github.com/evernym).

## About the challenge

This is a challenge, not a college test, so there are multiple correct answers.

We'll give you some requirements that must be done and for which you'll be evaluated, but you're free to choose a solution method.

What we expect to learn from you with this challenge:

- Your work style.
- How you think and solve problems.
- How you communicate.

What we expect that you learn from us:

- How we work as a team.
- Have a close look at some of the problems we face daily.

## Next steps

1. Fork this repository to your personal account.
2. Follow the instructions in the [`challenge-description`](/challenge-description.md) file.
3. Solve the challenge in the best way you canusing the framework of your choice.
4. Submit your code in a git repo (zipped and emailed, not on github) where you have committed throughout the process so that we can see your progress as you code the solution.

## Considerations

- We won't limit your choice of tools or libraries. But make choices that suits your needs. There's no need to use a bazooka to kill an ant but the point of the challenge is to evaluate your skills.
- Being a UI stack it is recommended you display your skills with the React framework and ecosystem. 
- Despite not having a time limit, we recommend that you don't spend more than **10 hours** working on this challenge.
- Try to write the best code you possibly can. It will make our life easier when evaluating your solution. Adding things like comments and tests are what would really help us out here.
